# Terminal Wars

Terminal Wars is an ASCII based console version of Advance Wars (particularly Dual Strike) in C++. It features most of the gameplay elements (strikeouted items are not yet implemented, but will be when finished).

* Colored representation of map and units.
* Land, ~~sea~~, and ~~air~~ units.
* ~~Numerous~~ (just one right now) maps and custom map support.
* ~~Movement and attacking systems~~.
* ~~Capturable buildings and objectives~~.
* ~~Rebindable controls~~.
* ~~In-game information about units~~.

This game was originally [a project I did for my first semester computing class at university in C](https://github.com/Biendeo/I-Am-Learning-To-Code/tree/master/009%20-%20Terminal%20Wars). It was a lot of effort to make, but overall it was quite simple to implement. This project is a bit more complex, allowing for easily adjustable statistics, custom maps, and more useful tools to making different kinds of programs. I want what I make to be a lot more reusable, which is why I'm now using C++ and I've started from scratch.

# Building

To compile the game, just run the Makefile in the Terminal Wars directory. If you're using Visual Studio, a solution is available to build from there. Ideally, your compiler should allow C++11 features.
